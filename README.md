# SQL HR Management Project

This SQL-based Human Resources project demonstrates how to manage employee records, departments, salaries, job roles, and performance metrics using a relational database system. It includes database design, real-world queries, views, and stored procedures.

1. Project Title & Overview

SQL HR Dataset Analysis Project
This project contains SQL queries written to analyze HR (Human Resources) dataset, answering multiple business questions related to employees, departments, salaries, and clients.

Goal â†’ Practice SQL skills (Joins, Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations) and derive insights useful for HR decision-making.

2. Dataset Description

The HR dataset contains multiple tables such as:

Employee â†’ Employee details (ID, Name, Email, Department, etc.)

EmpDept â†’ Department details (DeptId, DeptName, DeptHead, Dept_off)

EmpSalary â†’ Salary information (EmployeeId, Salary, IsPermanent, StartYear, EndYear)

ClientTable â†’ Client details linked to projects

Employee_1 â†’ Extended employee project assignments

3. SQL Concepts Covered

Your queries demonstrate:
âœ… Basic SQL â€“ SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, DISTINCT
âœ… Aggregations â€“ COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING
âœ… Joins â€“ INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
âœ… Subqueries â€“ nested queries for filtering and conditions
âœ… CTEs (Common Table Expressions) â€“ reusing query logic, simplifying analysis
âœ… Window Functions â€“ RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ...) for salary ranking
âœ… Stored Procedures â€“ parameterized analysis (example: calculating salary and employee count)

4. Key Business Questions Answered

Some important questions solved in your SQL scripts:

Find employees whose name starts with or contains certain characters.

Count permanent employees earning above a salary threshold.

Find department information for employees with specific conditions (e.g., Monday/Tuesday off).

Calculate total salary and categorize employees into salary bands (High, Average, Low).

Get employee ranking by salary (Highest, Lowest, Average).

List employees working under a specific department head or project.

Find projects that started and ended in the same year.

Identify clients based in specific countries.

Count employees working on live projects.
